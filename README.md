# Energy Savings

#### Designing a web widget where users can visualize the impact of their energy savings. Users who saved energy last month will see an illustration of the number of cars that were “removed from the road” by the user’s energy offset. The illustration should be designed to delight, so that users see it as a reward for saving electricity, and become motivated to continue doing so.

## Set up the web enironment
#### Install chrome browse 
(https://www.google.com/chrome/)

## Creating the website wireframe
#### I used the lucidchart to initial the wireframe which like a clear guideline that I will be used on my later actual coding.

## Buidling Basic Structure of Website
#### Step 1: Setup Basic Website Folder like required image files, html files, css files, js files. Put all the files into single project file, which will be convenience for your later work and push to the GitHub. 
#### Step 2: Add basic external files. Go to the jQuery website to download the compressed verizon of production jQuery 3.1.1, and move the file to the js file. (http://jquery.com/download/) 
#### Step 3: Choose the right fonts. Google Fonts is an amazing resource for choosing the fonts. Caution: this sequence of external css link and custom css link matters, remember put the google fonts css external link before the style css link. (https://fonts.google.com/)
